# Image browser

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## About the project

This is a image browser where you can search for images and when hit the enter button, 10 images will display on the screen.

For example, type dogs in the search bar and hit enter, then you will have a good day :)

With this project I am consolidating my knowledge about React (class based components).
